# Pseudo
The camera is activated
  the whole scene is coloured in a certain colour
  the face gets tracked

    getting the inner mouth, and nose features

    turning them to vectors

    calculating the nose size

    calculating the mouth stretch 

    setting the smile detection criteria:
    if 
       nose<40 && mouth >50
       nose<80 && mouth> 90

       change the colours of the scene
